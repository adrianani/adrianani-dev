Personal portfolio made with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)

## v1.0

Quite simple website, created using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), with a standard boilerplate generated with [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/).

* Simple grid to show a list of projects I've worked on
* Each item in the list has some tags which you can filter by if you are interested in a specific field of my work.
