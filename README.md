Personal portfolio made with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)

## v1.0

Quite a simple website, using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), with a standard boilerplate created with [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) storing content in the state of the __Articles__ component.

* Simple grid to show a list of projects I've worked on
* Each item in the list has some tags which you can filter by if you are interested in a specific field of my work.
